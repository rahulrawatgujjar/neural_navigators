# Return Risk Prediction

## Problem

The objective of this project is to predict whether a customer will return a product after purchase or not. For example, if a customer buys a product worth ₹1000, such as an RC car, the system should be able to predict whether the customer is likely to return the product or keep it.  
This project aims to reduce the return rate and increase the overall profit margin, which ultimately contributes to higher business profitability.
